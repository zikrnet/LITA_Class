## QUOTES: The capacity to learn is a gift; the ability to learn is a skill; the willingness to learn is a choice. - Brian Herbert

## 1. FOUNDATIONS OF DATA
A data foundation refers to the fundamental infrastructure, processes, and strategies that lay the groundwork for effectively collecting, managing, storing, organizing, and leveraging enterprise data. A data foundation will allow you to consider your data as a single entity, rather than disparate, largely unrelated pieces of information.

## 2. Introduction to Ms-Excel
Microsoft Excel is a popular spreadsheet software program for business. It's used for data entry and management, charts and graphs, and project management. Excel contains the workbook where we see multiple worksheets

# Basic Excel Functions

1. SUM
The Excel SUM function returns the sum of all inserted values. For the input, you can combine any sort of numerical values, e.g. numbers, cell references, ranges or arrays.
```
SUM (number1, [number2], [number3], …)
```
2. AVERAGE
The Excel AVERAGE function returns the average of all inserted values. For the input, you can combine any sort of numerical values, e.g. numbers, cell references, ranges or arrays.
```
Syntax: AVERAGE (number1, [number2], [number3], …)
```
3. IF FUNCTION
The Excel IF function is the most essential function in Excel for logical tests. You can define the value that is returned by this function if the result of the logical test is TRUE and the value that is returned if the result is FALSE. If you want to test more than one condition, you can simply nest multiple IF functions.
```
Syntax: IF  (logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])
```
4. MIN & MAX Function
The Excel MIN function returns the smallest numeric value in a range of values. Accordingly, the Excel MAX function returns the biggest numeric value in a range of values. Both function only consider numeric values. Empty cells, logical or text values will be ignored.
```
Syntax: MIN (number1, [number2], …)    |      MAX (number1, [number2], …)
```
5. TRIM Function
The Excel TRIM function removes the leading and trailing spaces from a given text. Additionally, it removes unnecessary spaces between words.
```
Syntax: TRIM (text)
```
6. CONCATENATE Function
The Excel CONCATENATE function joins two or more text items together.
```
Syntax: CONCATENATE (text1, [text2], …)
```

## 4. REPORT AND DASHBOARD IN EXCEL
An Excel dashboard is basically a high-level visual representation of key business metrics.

## Steps to Create a Dashboard in Excel
Here’s a simple set of steps to follow to create an Excel dashboard:
- Step 1: Pull your raw data into Excel
If your data already exists in an Excel spreadsheet, go ahead and skip this step. If not, here are some ways to import data into Excel:
1. Simply copy and paste
2. Use Microsoft PowerQuery to import data from different sources like CSV files, PDFs, tables, folders, SQL servers, and many more platforms.

- Step 2: Set up a structure for your workbook
Keep your dashboard at the beginning of your new Excel workbook, and add one or more worksheets with your data in them. Name your first sheet ‘Dashboard’ and the other tab ‘Data’ for easy reference.

- Step 3: Create a table
Creating a table isn’t a mandatory step, but it makes the process of creating charts much more efficient. Tables have the ability to expand as you add new data and perform calculations easily.

First select the data and go to Insert>Table. Excel will automatically create a table, and you can apply your preferred table style. Give your table an appropriate name so you can reference it easily instead of having to select the data range every time.

- Step 4: Visualize your data
There are many ways to analyze your data on Excel, and you should go for the option that suits the overall goal for the dashboard. Here are the commonly used methods of visualizing data:
1. Pivot Table
2. Charts
3. Excel Formulas
4. Conditional formatting
5. Pivot tables are the most useful method for the purposes of a dashboard, as they let you sort, group, count, and add up data in a table.

- Step 5: Create a Pivot Table
Use a new worksheet on Excel to do this, since it can take some time to figure out properly. In the worksheet, go to Insert>PivotTable, and enter the name of your table.
Arrange the table fields depending on what you want to see. Now you can insert a PivotChart based on the PivotTable. You could also go with a pie chart, bar graph, Gantt chart, waterfall chart, stacked column chart, line graph, and more.

## MICROSOFT EXCEL - DATA ENTRY IN EXCEL 
Data Entry Form is a form that helps to enter the data with the help of a form in which the data can be added, searched, and previous data can be deleted.

# POWERBI
PowerBI is a collection of software services, apps and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive and interactive insights.
# PowerBI - Interface 
![powerbi interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a6faa8a-1d10-4f52-b562-c6be7b2f075e)
# PowerBI - Report View
![report view in powerbi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bbd5b685-35c2-4995-a04e-a594be974d59)

## Data Sources for PowerBI
1. Excel
2. Cloud and Tables
3. SQL
4. Web

## Components of PowerBI
1. PowerBI Desktop: This is used to create reports and data visualization on data set
2. PowerBI Gateway: It allows you to query large datasets and benefit from the existing investment
3. PowerBI Mobile Apps: using PowerBI Mobile Apps, you can stay connected to their data from anywhere
4. PowerBI Service: This is a cloud service and is sued to publish PowerBI

## Data Sources
1.  Flat Files
2.  SQL Database
3.  OData Feed (Ordinary Database)
4.  Blank Query
5.  Azure Cloud Platfrom
6.  Online Services
7.  Blank Query

## Data Modelling
Data Modelling is one of the features used to connect multiples data sources using a relationship. A relationship defines how data sources are connected with eachother and you can create interesting data visualization on mulltiple data sources. 
- One-to-One
- One-to-Many
- Many-to-Many
Visualizations are used to efefctively present your data and are the basic building blocks of any business intelligence tool.

## Visualization Options
Step 1:  Define questions and goals
Step 2:  Collect Data
Step 3:  Data Wrangling
Step 4:  Determine Analysis
Step 5:  Interpret Results

## Data Analysis Expressions
DAX functions play an important roles in the usage of DAX for data modelling and reporting. DAX is a formula language and is a collection of functions, operators and constants that can be used in a formula or expression to calculate and return one or more values. 

## PRINCIPLES OF DATA VISUALIZATION
1.  Determine your audience
2.  Choose the right kind of chart to depict the type of information you have
3.  Focus on how your audience needs to use the data
4.  Provide the necessary context for data to be interpreted and acted upon appropriately
5.  Keep it simple
6.  Choose colors carefully to draw attention while also considering accessibility issues such as contrast
7.  Seek balance in your visual elements including text, color, shape etc
8.  Use Patterns
9.  Use proportion carefully so that differences in design size fairly represent differences in value 

# POWERBI FUNDAMENTAL
Power BI Fundamentals is for analysts looking to create professional, meaningful, and intuitive Power BI reports from a variety of data sources.

# GET DATA
- To connect to data, from the Home ribbon select Get data. 
- The Get Data window appears. 
- You can choose from the many different data sources to which Power BI Desktop can connect.

## Transform Data
Transforming data helps clean and standardize it, ensuring accurate reporting and analysis.

## POWER QUERY FOR DATA TRANSFORMATION
Power Query is a data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) tool that comes bundled with Microsoft Excel, Power BI, and other Microsoft applications.

## APPENDING 
In Power Query, the Append operation creates a new query that contains all rows from a first query followed by all rows from a second query.


![APPENDING DATA](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/590800b5-2e9d-4894-b903-896131333b83)


## APPENDING MORE THAN ONE TABLE
Appending: to join two table together to continue from where the last table stopped.
Note: Appending data must have the same schema (attribute).
